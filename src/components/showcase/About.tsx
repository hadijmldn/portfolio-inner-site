                <br />
                <p>
                    From a young age, I have had a curiosity about how things
                    worked. This naturally led me to become absolutely obsessed
                    with Lego and I fell in love with building things.

                    I started programming more seriously in high school,
                    initially learning how to scrape and interact with websites.
                    I went on to do a ton of passion projects, many of them with
                    one of my closest friends
                    . We worked on many projects together, including chat bots,
                    multiple game projects, apps, and more. One of these
                    projects is viewable on my{' '}

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have are Music
                            and creating
                            Digital Art. Some other hobbies I
                            enjoy are working out, cooking, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.

                            the chapter. I met a lot of amazing people through
